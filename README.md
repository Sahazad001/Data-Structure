DATA STRUCTURE ASSIGNMENT

This repository contains my Python implementation of fundamental data structures, including arrays, lists, strings, tuples and dictionary.
The project is designed to provide a practical understanding of how these data structures operate and can be utilized to solve complex computational problems efficiently.
Each data structure is implemented from scratch with detailed comments and example usage.
